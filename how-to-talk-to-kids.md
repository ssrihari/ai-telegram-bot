## Tools for Handling Emotions

### 1. Acknowledge Feelings with Words
> “You were looking forward to that playdate. How disappointing!”
> “It can be so frustrating when train tracks fall apart.”

### 2. Acknowledge Feelings with Writing
> “Oh no! We don’t have the ingredients we need! Let’s make a shopping list.”
> “You really want that underwater Lego set. Let’s write that down on your wish list.”

### 3. Acknowledge Feelings with Art
> “You seem so sad.” (Draw a stick figure with big tears, or simply hand over a crayon or pencil.)
> “You are this angry!” (Make angry lines or rip and crumple paper.)

### 4. Give in Fantasy What You Cannot Give in Reality
> “I wish we had a million billion more hours to play.”

### 5. Acknowledge Feelings with (Almost) Silent Attention
> “Ugh!” “Mmm.” “Ooh.” “Huh.”

**All feelings can be accepted. Some actions must be limited!**
- Sit on those “buts.” Substitute: “The problem is…” or “Even though you know…”
- Match the emotion. Be dramatic!
- Resist the urge to ask questions of a distressed child.

## Tools for Engaging Cooperation

### 1. Be Playful
- Make it a game:
> “Can we get all the cars into the box before the timer beeps? Ready… set… go!”
- Make inanimate objects talk:
> “I’m an empty sock. I need a foot in me!”
- Use silly voices and accents:
> “I… am… your… robot… Must… buckle… seat… belt… now.”
- Pretend:
> “We need to climb this slippery mountain into the carseat.”
- Play the incompetent fool:
> “Oh dear, where does this sleeve go? Over your head? No? On the arm? This is so confusing! Thank you for helping me!”

### 2. Offer a Choice
> “Do you want to hop to the tub like a bunny, or crawl to the tub like a crab?”

### 3. Put the Child in Charge
> “Johnny, would you set the timer and let us know when it’s time to leave?”

### 4. Give Information
> “Tissues go in the trash.”

### 5. Say It with a Word (or a Gesture)
> “Trash!”

### 6. Describe What You See
> “I see most of the blocks put away in the toy box. There are only a few blocks left to go.”

### 7. Describe How You Feel
> “I don’t like food thrown on the floor.”

### 8. Write a Note
> “Put me on your head before riding. Love, your bike helmet.”

### 9. Take Action Without Insult
> “I’m putting the paint away for now. I can’t let you splatter the other kids.”

**Guidance:**
- Don’t turn a choice into a threat. Make sure both options are acceptable.
- Appreciate progress before describing what’s left to do.
- When expressing anger or frustration, use “I,” avoid “you.”
- Express strong anger sparingly—it can feel like an attack.
